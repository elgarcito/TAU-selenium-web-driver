## Introduction 

In this repository, you can find all the solutions to the
course: **Selenium WebDriver with Java** from the Test
Automation University. 

Each **Optional Independent Exercise** from each chapter is going to 
have a separate branch.


### Chapter 3 Finding web elements.
For this chapter, I'd like to give you an optional exercise that you can try on your own.
Go to our test site, the-internet, and use the findElement and findElements to complete the following scenario.
* Click on the “Shifting Content” link.
* Then click on the first example Menu Element.
* Then print how many of these menu elements appear.

### Solution 
The elements were found using Css selectors. The number of elements in the header
was displayed counting the number of elements in the list.
