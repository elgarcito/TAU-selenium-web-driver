## Introduction 

In this repository, you can find all the solutions to the
course: **Selenium WebDriver with Java** from the Test
Automation University. 

In the main branch, we are going to save the same activities
done in the theoretical classes.Each commit is going to have
the name of the class finished (available from chapter 4.2).

Each **Optional Independent Exercise** from each chapter is going to 
have a separate branch.

### Chapter 2 Finding web elements.
For your optional independent exercise, go to our site, 
The Internet, and click on the Forgot Password link.
Enter an email address here. The email can be anything.
For example, “tau@example.com” so it doesn't have to be a real 
email address.
Click this Retrieve Password button and verify on this new page
that you have this message saying, “Your e-mail's been sent!”.
Good luck!

created and the forgotPassword package with the ForgotPasswordTest.java.
