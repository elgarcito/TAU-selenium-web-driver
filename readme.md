## Introduction 

In this repository, you can find all the solutions to the
course: **Selenium WebDriver with Java** from the Test
Automation University. 

In the main branch, we are going to save the same activities
done in the theoretical classes.Each commit is going to have
the name of the class finished (available from chapter 4.2).

Each **Optional Independent Exercise** from each chapter is going to 
have a separate branch.
